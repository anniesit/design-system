# Design System

A personal design system based on [MAST](https://github.com/nocodesupplyco/mast) by No-Code Supply Co, organized for use across multiple Webflow projects via jsDelivr CDN.

## What's been extracted

All inline `<style>` and `<script>` blocks from MAST's exported `components.html`
have been moved into the files above, **without modification**. Each file matches
the grouping that appears in Webflow's Global Custom Code panel.

## JS source files

All component JS has been extracted from MAST's CDN and committed directly
into this repo. The source for each component is in its folder alongside the CSS.
The `tabs.js` file is a custom build with accessibility improvements over the
original MAST source.

## External dependencies (not forked)

These come from third-party CDNs and stay there:

- **Phosphor Icons** — `https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/web@2.1.1/src/regular/style.css`
- **Swiper CSS** — `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css`
- **Swiper JS** — `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js`

## Attribution & licensing

This system is derived from [MAST](https://www.nocodesupply.co/mast) by
[No-Code Supply Co.](https://www.nocodesupply.co) © 2022 No-Code Supply Co.

MAST is distributed as a free Webflow cloneable framework and its JavaScript
is hosted on a public CDN, but **No-Code Supply Co. has not published an explicit
open-source licence** — there is no LICENSE file in their GitHub repo and their
terms page only covers trademarks and ownership without specifying permitted use
of MAST itself.

This repo contains modified MAST source code hosted publicly. If you intend to
use this design system beyond internal institutional projects, or if you have any
doubt about permitted use, contact No-Code Supply Co. directly for clarification
before proceeding.

## Linking the files

Always use a version tag, never `@main`. Tagged URLs are permanently cached on
jsDelivr and never need purging. `@main` can serve stale content for up to 7 days.

```html
<!-- In Webflow Project Settings → Custom Code → Head -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/anniesit/design-system@0.2.0/bundles/all.css">

<!-- In Webflow Project Settings → Custom Code → Before </body> -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/anniesit/design-system@0.2.0/bundles/all.js" defer></script>
```

For the Webflow designer to load styles, also add these inside a `w-embed` block
in the canvas (e.g. inside the `custom-code-component`):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@phosphor-icons/web@2.1.1/src/regular/style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/anniesit/design-system@0.2.0/bundles/all.css">
```

## Per-project configuration (DS_CONFIG)

The bundle reads from `window.DS_CONFIG` if it exists. Set this in a `<script>`
block **before** `all.js` loads to override defaults for a specific project or page.

```html
<script>
  window.DS_CONFIG = {
    themeKey:      'my-project-theme',  // localStorage key for dark/light mode
    navBreakpoint: 992,                 // mobile nav reset breakpoint in px
    tocBreakpoint: 992                  // breakpoint at which TOC becomes a dropdown
  };
</script>
```

| Option | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `themeKey` | `'savedTheme'` | localStorage key for the theme toggle. **Must be unique per project on shared domains** to prevent one project's theme setting overriding another's |
| `navBreakpoint` | `992` | Pixel width at which the mobile nav state resets on window resize |
| `tocBreakpoint` | `992` | Pixel width below which the TOC becomes a dropdown, adding its height to scroll-to-anchor offset calculations |

**Setting per page in Webflow:** each page has its own Page Settings → Custom Code
fields. Put the `DS_CONFIG` script there to override settings on specific pages
without affecting others.

**You only need to set the values that differ from defaults.** Omitted keys fall
back to the defaults shown above.

## Per-project typography

`cjk-setting.css` at the repo root is a template for typography tokens — fonts,
heading sizes, line heights, weights, letter spacing. It is **not included in
the bundle** and must be set up separately for each project:

1. Duplicate `cjk-setting.css` into your project folder
2. Rename and customise it for that project's typeface and scale
3. Link it in Webflow **after** `all.css` so its variables take effect:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="...all.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="[your-project-typography.css]">
```

Variables in this file override the defaults set in MAST's base CSS.

## Release workflow

Every time you change source files and want them live:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild the bundles
bash build.sh

# 2. Commit source files and bundles together
git add -A
git commit -m "your message"
git push

# 3. Tag the release
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

Then in Webflow, update the version number in all CDN links (`@0.2.0` → `@0.3.0`)
and republish the site. Each project can be updated independently on its own schedule.
